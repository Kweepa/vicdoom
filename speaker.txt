[1]: Introduction
=================

When Doom was released in 1993, digital sound cards were not as ubiquitous 
as they have now become.  As a result, a large percentage of PCs did not
have the ability to play digital audio.  

To work around this problem, when Id wrote Doom they included support for
two different sound formats.  The main one is the digital sound format,
which supports 8-bit mono sound effects; this is used for the sound blaster
and all other sound cards supported by Doom.  The second is the PC speaker 
format, which uses the speaker built in to every PC to make basic beeping
sound effects.

PC speaker sound effects can be enabled by setting snd_sfxdevice to 1
in the Doom configuration file (usually named default.cfg).

While the basic structure of PC speaker sound effects has been known 
since the early days of Doom (see the Unofficial Doom Specs), its 
complete format has not been properly documented before now.  The 
reasons for this are mainly those of indifference: the ubiquity of 
digital sound cards means that there is little interest in playing PC 
speaker sound effects.

Determining the format of PC speaker sound effects has been made more 
difficult as the code to play them is not present in the released Doom
source code: either it depended on the proprietary DMX sound library or
was simply removed with the other sound code before the source release.


[2]: File format
================

[2-1]: Lump naming
==================

The PC speaker sound data is stored in the main IWAD file, along with other
resources used by Doom.  The IWAD contains a lump resource for each sound
effect, each of which has a name up to 8 characters long.  The first 
two characters of each PC speaker effect are "DP"; the remaining six 
characters identify the sound.  This is the same format as is used for
digital sound effects, which use the prefix "DS".  The six character
names match those used for the digital effects.

As an example, the digital sound effect for firing the pistol is named 
"DSPISTOL"; the corresponding PC speaker sound effect is "DPPISTOL".


[2-2]: Header
=============

PC speaker effects have a four byte header.  The first two bytes are
always zero.  The third and fourth bytes are a 16-bit little endian value 
specifying the length of the sound effect in samples.  The sample rate
is 140 samples per second; for example, a sound effect 70 samples long
will take half a second to play.


[2-3]: Data format
==================

Immediately following the header is the sound sample data; the number of
samples is specified in the header.  Each sample is a single byte.

The sample values map to frequencies: higher sample values correspond to
higher frequencies.  The scale used is a musical one: the samples 
correspond to frequencies of notes in the western musical scale.  As
such, the frequency of the notes increases exponentially.  There are
24 values per octave, whereas the western musical scale has 12 semitones 
per octave.  The sample values are in fact a superset of the western 
musical scale, with an extra value inserted between each semitone.

As a consequence of the above, adding 24 to the value of a sample will
double the frequency.  The values start at 175Hz, which is a low "F".

A table of the frequencies is given in section 2-4.

A value of zero indicates silence.


[2-4]: Frequency Table
======================

This table specifies the frequency for values in PC speaker sound effects.
The value is given along with the corresponding output frequency and the
precise counter value which should be programmed into the 8253 timer chip
found in PCs to give this frequency.  

This table is only given for the range 0..95, which is the range of values
used by the Doom PC speaker sound effects.  It is not known if higher
values are supported.

In some cases, the frequency is off by one or two hz, this is due to
loss of precision in calculations, and is an inherent limitation of 
the 8253 chip.

[3]: Method of research
=======================

Although the basic structure of the file format is relatively trivial to
reverse engineer, the mapping of sample values to actual frequencies has 
not been known until now.

The frequencies were found by running DOS Doom inside a modified version
of DOSBox.  This version of DOSBox was instrumented to output the timer
values written to the emulated 8253 timer chip (PCSPEAKER_SetCounter in
dosbox/src/hardware/pcspeaker.cpp).  Doom was then run using a WAD
containing a replacement DPPISTOL lump, crafted to cycle through all 
of the sample values from 1..95.  The output from DOSBox then gave the
timer countdown value for each sample.  These were put into a spreadsheet
and used to calculate the corresponding frequency.
